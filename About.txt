1. Firstly we c reated the backend of our app - i.e server
2. We have a plan to send data from our backend to fronetned
3. Then we install react js
4. We then installed Chakra Ui
5. We then installed Brower Router
6. We then install react-router-dom version 5 for multiple pages
7. We created two pages - Homepage.js and ChatPage.js
8. Imported it to App.js
9 Gave both of them paths as :
    <Route path='/chats' component={ChatPage} />
10. we give attribute exact to load only the current page and not all the pages at the same time while giving the the path

11. Now we will fetch the chats to ChatsPage
12. To fetch the chats we will use a a library : "axios"
     <Route path='/' component={HomePage} exact />
There are two pages in the website : 
    1. Homepage for log in
    2. Chat Page

13. Now, going to define Schema and Models with mongoose
